1. catsem: how to avoid starvation.
	Both cats and mice can wait on bowls and they will be given a bowl base on the order they wait. Once a mouse gets a bowl, it will wait until there is no cat eating. Once a cat gets a bowl, it also will wait until there is no mouse eating. Because if two cats or two mice get the bowls on the wait sequence, the two cats or the two mice wouldn't need to wait. So this guarantees there is no starvation.
